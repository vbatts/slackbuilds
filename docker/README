Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a
developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs,
bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.

to use docker as a limited user, add your user to the 'docker' group

 	#> groupadd -r -g 278 docker
	#> usermod -a -G docker <your_username>

This will require log out and login

To have the docker daemon start and stop with you host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.docker start
	fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.docker stop
	fi

runtime.
